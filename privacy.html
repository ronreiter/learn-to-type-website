            I collect data and information (through third party

            include information such as your device Internet Protocol
            (“IP”) address, device name, operating system version, the
            configuration of the app when utilizing my Service,

        </p>
        <p><strong>Cookies</strong></p>
        <p>
            Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are
            commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent
            to your browser from the websites that you visit and are

        <p>
            This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However,
            the app may use third party code and libraries that use
            “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
            You have the option to either accept or refuse these cookies
            and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you

        <p><strong>Service Providers</strong></p>
        <p>
            I may employ third-party companies and
            individuals due to the following reasons:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>

            I want to inform users of this Service
            that these third parties have access to your Personal
            Information. The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to
            them on our behalf. However, they are obligated not to
            disclose or use the information for any other purpose.
        </p>
        <p><strong>Security</strong></p>
        <p>
            I value your trust in providing us your
            Personal Information, thus we are striving to use commercially
            acceptable means of protecting it. But remember that no method
            of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic
            storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot
            guarantee its absolute security.

            that these external sites are not operated by me.
            Therefore, I strongly advise you to review the
            Privacy Policy of these websites. I have

            I do not knowingly collect personally
            identifiable information from children under 13. In the case
            I discover that a child under 13 has provided
            me with personal information, I immediately
            delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian
            and you are aware that your child has provided us with
            personal information, please contact me so that
            I will be able to do necessary actions.
        </p>
